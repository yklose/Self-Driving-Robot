## Abstract
The aim of this project is to design a tracking algorithm that is able to identify a predefined pattern in an unknown environment. The algorithm will be used to automatically control a Loomo robot to follow a person with the predefined pattern. For this specific task a neural network architecture based on the opensource library openpifpaf is used. In order to improve the model data exploration, image expansion and hyper parameter search is applied. 


## Run the model
To run the model the MS-COCO Dataset has to be downloaded (approx. 23 GB). Futhermore a powerful computer with GPU is importante.
